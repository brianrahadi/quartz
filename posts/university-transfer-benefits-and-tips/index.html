<a href=https://www.sfuia.com/blog/university-transfer-benefits-and-tips rel=noopener target=_blank>this sfu blog</a>. I cross-post it as I was the writer and want to provide more content to my personal website. Hope you enjoy it!</p><a href=#intro><h2 id=intro><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Intro</h2></a><p>Studying in Canada can be a very costly decision. Especially for those who have just finished high school, it can be daunting for many of us to whether we choose the career that we want. Going to community college can ease that decision.</p><a href=#background><h2 id=background><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Background</h2></a><p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Brian. I previously graduated from Langara College with an Associate of Science in Computer Science. Now, I am continuing my study at SFU studying Software Systems. I enjoyed my time at Langara and highly recommend taking courses there.</p><a href=#benefits><h2 id=benefits><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Benefits</h2></a><p>There are numerous benefits to having your first two years at a community college.</p><a href=#1-cheaper><h3 id=1-cheaper><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1. Cheaper</h3></a><p>The biggest reason for most is saving money. As of Sept 1, 2022, A single 3-credit course costs $1,876,20 at Langara and $1,872,25 at Douglas. The same 3-credit course costs $3,177.45 at SFU and $3,314.19 at FIC. Taking your first 60 credits (2 years) at community college will save you a lot of money. While FIC is also a college, it is important to keep in mind that its tuition fee is more expensive than SFU.</p><a href=#2-smaller-class-size><h3 id=2-smaller-class-size><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2. Smaller Class Size</h3></a><p>Like FIC, classes in community colleges like Langara, Douglas, and Columbia are smaller. This is usually an advantage for most students as the class&rsquo;s instructor will be more accessible. In my experience, the lectures I attended in Langara was more engaging and allowed me to ask question easier if needed.</p><a href=#3-more-flexible><h3 id=3-more-flexible><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3. More Flexible</h3></a><p>Taking classes in community college is also more flexible in terms of 2 things: changing majors and universities. It is not uncommon for students to change their majors as it may not be it for them. Changing majors in community college is usually easier and less restrictive. Keep in mind, it is definitely possible to change major at SFU. However, in certain cases, changing to a certain major requires having a competitive GPA in the needed courses of that major.</p><p>You can also still decide which university you are going to attend. The top two that most people choose here are either UBC (University of British Columbia) or SFU.</p><a href=#4-post-graduation-work-permit-international-students><h3 id=4-post-graduation-work-permit-international-students><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4. Post-Graduation Work Permit (International Students)</h3></a><p>The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from eligible Canadian designated learning institutions (DLIs) to obtain an open work permit to gain valuable Canadian work experience (
<a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html rel=noopener target=_blank>source</a>).</p><p>Graduating with an associate degree allows students to have 3 years work permit (
<a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program/permit.html rel=noopener target=_blank>source</a>). This is very useful as it provides options for students to work first to get permanent residence before continuing their bachelor&rsquo;s degree (with hopefully domestic tuition cost after the permanent residence). While some students may not use it and go straight to university, it acts as a safety net in case they need/ want to fall back and work full-time.</p><a href=#drawbacks><h2 id=drawbacks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Drawbacks</h2></a><p>There may also be certain drawbacks to pursuing community college first.</p><a href=#1-not-guaranteed-entry><h3 id=1-not-guaranteed-entry><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1. Not Guaranteed Entry</h3></a><p>To transfer to SFU, students need to make sure they fulfill the university requirements and most importantly, have a competitive GPA for transferring.</p><p>Checking
<a href=https://www.sfu.ca/students/admission/apply/admission-averages.html rel=noopener target=_blank>Admission Averages</a> is important to make sure you know the GPA is above the accepted range.</p><a href=#2-course-planning-is-harder><h3 id=2-course-planning-is-harder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2. Course Planning is Harder</h3></a><p>Course Planning is harder because you need to make sure that the courses you take are (1) transferrable and applicable at the transferring university and (2) useful for your associate graduation requirements if needed.</p><p>Sometimes, certain courses are not just offered in the community college. Therefore, students will usually just take general electives.</p><a href=#3-lesser-research-club-opportunities><h3 id=3-lesser-research-club-opportunities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3. Lesser Research/ Club Opportunities</h3></a><p>Due to community colleges, in general, being smaller, there are lesser professors who hire students researchers. However, keep in mind that lesser does not mean unavailable. There are still plenty of opportunities and getting a research role is usually less competitive than in a university.</p><p>The other drawback is that community colleges have lesser clubs. Clubs still exist, but it is not as many and diverse as club offered in universities.</p><a href=#4-delayed-co-op><h3 id=4-delayed-co-op><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4. Delayed Co-op</h3></a><p>Co-operative Education is an educational model that formally integrates academic study with relevant, paid work experience.</p><p>A student who starts their first year at university can take their co-op as early as the start of their second year with most starting their first co-op term at the end of the second year. If you were to finish your first two years at a community college, the earliest you can take a co-op term is the end of your third year. At SFU, you need to have SFU GPA in order to apply to co-op.</p><p>The first term is the workshop term where students learn about resumes, cover letter, and job interviews and the second term is the seeking term to look for jobs. Thus, transfer students need to have 12 months at SFU before starting their first co-op jobs (1st term to get SFU GPA, 2nd and 3rd for workshop and seeking).</p><a href=#5-gpa-is-reset><h3 id=5-gpa-is-reset><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5. GPA is Reset</h3></a><p>This is a minor drawback. But transferring means your GPA at university will be reset. It is not a definite drawback as it can be an advantage for some students to restart their GPA.</p><a href=#tips><h2 id=tips><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tips</h2></a><p>While every major requires different courses to take to transfer, I will present the general guideline here for a successful transfer.</p><ol><li>Check
<a href=https://www.sfu.ca/students/admission/admission-requirements/transfer/college-university.html rel=noopener target=_blank>SFU Transfer Requirements</a> to ensure you fulfill all the requirements for the transfer</li><li>Use
<a href=https://www.bctransferguide.ca/transfer-options/search-courses/ rel=noopener target=_blank>BCTransferGuide </a>and SFU Undergraduate Major requirements to check what course is transferred and needed to the major</li><li>Keeping your GPA above
<a href=https://www.sfu.ca/students/admission/apply/admission-averages.html rel=noopener target=_blank>Admission Average</a> is more important than taking the needed course in university as long as the overall requirement to transfer is already fulfilled</li><li>SFU offers $3,500
<a href=https://www.sfu.ca/students/financialaid/entrance/regulations/transfer-scholarships.html rel=noopener target=_blank>transfer scholarship</a> for those who have GPA above 3.7</li><li>Associate degree holders will have a preference in admission by having their GPA 0.25 less than required (
<a href=https://www.bctransferguide.ca/learn-more-about/associate-degrees/transfer/ rel=noopener target=_blank>source</a>)</li><li>Consulting an academic advisor is really helpful whenever you are in doubt.</li></ol><a href=#conclusion><h2 id=conclusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion</h2></a><p>Transferring can be a daunting process for many people. I have also had my share of anxiety when planning the courses. The best advice I can give is to enjoy the process. Looking back, I missed the experience of taking classes at Langara and talking to instructor that is more accessible.</p><a href=#references><h2 id=references><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>References</h2></a><ul><li><a href=https://langara.ca/registration-and-records/tuition-and-service-fees/international-student-fees.html rel=noopener target=_blank>https://langara.ca/registration-and-records/tuition-and-service-fees/international-student-fees.html</a></li><li><a href=https://www.douglascollege.ca/sites/default/files/docs/fees-and-related-information/International-Fee-Schedule-202230-Revised.pdf rel=noopener target=_blank>https://www.douglascollege.ca/sites/default/files/docs/fees-and-related-information/International%20Fee%20Schedule%20202230%20Revised.pdf</a></li><li><a href=http://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2023/spring/fees-and-regulations/tuition-fees/undergraduate.html#internationalstudents rel=noopener target=_blank>http://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2023/spring/fees-and-regulations/tuition-fees/undergraduate.html#internationalstudents</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://www.brianrahadi.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons class="delay t-5"><footer><p>Made by Brian Rahadi using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.brianrahadi.com/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/brianrahadi>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/brianrahadi>LinkedIn</a></li></ul></footer></div>html:</div></body></html>
