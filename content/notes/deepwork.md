**What is Deep Work?** \
“Professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”

**Types of Deep Work**
- Monastic → Full deep work, Bimodal → Seasonal deep Work, Journalistic → Anytime deep work
- The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling  → The easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to make it a habit. (Block off several hours everyday for deep work)


**Building Deep Work Routine**
1. Location → Distraction free for long periods of focus. Use noise canceling headphones and be consistent with your environment.
2. Duration → Start small and use podomoro technique
3. Structure → Define your deep work. (Phone shut down, measurement of success)
4. Requirements → Music choice, beverage of choice

**Execute a Grand Gesture**

> “By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.”
