- Self-help advice which tells you to become the person you want to be only reinforces the idea that you are not that thing
- Pursuing something only reinforces that you lack it in the first place.
- Everyone wants you to believe that the secret to a good life is to have a nicer job or a better car or a prettier girlfriend.
- The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.
- Because there’s an infinite amount of things we can now see or know, there are also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we don’t measure up, that we’re not good enough, that things aren’t as great as they could be.
- The desire for a more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.
- Accepting your experience of life as being great and wonderful is the single greatest thing you can do for your happiness.
- If you are able to not give a fuck about the pain your goals require, then you become unstoppable.
- The moments when we don’t give a fuck and take action are often the moments that most define the course of our lives.
- Don't hope for a life without problems. Hope for a life with good problems.
- Negative emotions are a sign that something is going unaddressed. They are a call to action. Positive emotions are the reward for taking the correct action
- Certainty is the enemy of growth.
- All beliefs are wrong—some are just less wrong than others.
- Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship for the simple reason that without trust the relationship doesn’t actually mean anything.
