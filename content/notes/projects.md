## sfuia.com

Simon Fraser University Indonesian Association's website acts as the information hub for Indonesian students at SFU. Currently, we use Next.js (framework of react.js) as it feels nicer to build with its routing, better images, and rendering. I decided to use Contentful to allow people to contribute to the blog post easily without accessing the source code (easily published and editted).

Stack: Next.js, Bootstrap, SASS, Contentful API (for blog), SendGrid API (for mail), Vercel
