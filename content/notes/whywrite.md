In my transition period from junior high to high school years, I used to be paid to write. Sounds cool at first, until I told everyone that I am just writing for a [game guide](https://bewient.wordpress.com/).

Looking back, I regret that I did not write as much again. Aside from the good money that I got from writing the blog posts, I got to know more about the game mechanics. **Writing has helped me to refine my understanding of the game, allowing me to become a better player**.

I never wrote anymore until I came past a book called [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.ca/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y) in my senior year of high school. This book taught me many benefits of writing. This is one of the main quotes that I really resonated with:

> The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe - Sönke Ahrens

There are many more things that I got from this book, but the main one is those who write are those who constantly refine their understanding of what is a good argument and what isn't.

Writing will truly challenge your way of thinking. Good writing can summarize a big idea as clearly and concisely as possible. I am still far from that, but I will try!

For now, I will try to write more when I am learning any topic in college or outside of it

So, write more to become a better 'player' in whatever 'game' you are playing right now ;).
