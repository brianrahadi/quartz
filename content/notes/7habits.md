> We need a paradigm, paradigm is the way you see something, your point of view. Paradigms need to be principle-centered

1. Be Proactive
    - Proactive is the opposite of reactive. They are the one who have the control over your attitude. They make choices based on values. They think before they act. They recognize that they canâ€™t control everything that happens to them, but they can control what they do about it.
    - Being proactive is a price to be paid. You need to have responsibility over your choices, find a way to make something happen, and focus on things that you can do. There is only one thing we can control, it is how we respond to what happens to us.
    
2. Begin with the End in Mind
    - Set our dreams to become reality. Try to imagine what our future self will be one year from now.
    - We need to have our personal mission statement, motto or personal quote that visualize what our life is all about.
    
3. Put First Things First
    - Urgent + Important = Procrastinator
    - Urgent + Not important = Yes-man (peer pressure)
    - Not Urgent + Important = Prioritizer
    - Not Urgent + Not Important =  Slacker
4. Think Win-Win
    - Respect each other equally. Never aim for a situation that only benefits one party
5. Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
    - Eyes + Heart + Ears > Mouth
    - Feel the emotion they express rather than each words they presented
6. Synergize
    - 2 heads always better than one
    - Everyone learn and think differently.
    - Define Problem â†’ Your way â†’ My way â†’ Brainstorming â†’ High Way
7. Sharpen the Saw
    - 4 body parts you should train regularly
        - Body â†’ Exercise, eat healthy, sleep well, and relax
        - Brain â†’ Education, side hustle
        - Heart â†’ Train your emotions so you are the one that control it. Focus on PBA and RBA
        - Soul â†’ Devotion, journalling, meditating.
