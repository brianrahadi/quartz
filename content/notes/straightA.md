1. Study in focused, but short blocks rather than pseudo-working through the night.
    - Find your ideal study length. (50 minutes with 10 minutes rests, 30-5)
    - Manage the time in daily calendar that can be updated so you can strictly follow it.
2. Find your most common excuses with a work progress journal
    - Write down the important tasks of each day and check off everything you've accomplished at night
    - Give an explanation for everything that didn't get done.
3. Use the three P's to move through exams smoothly
    1. Planning â†’ Flip through the entire exam with questions to answer, and map out the time needed to answer those questions.
    2. Proceeding â†’ Answer the question starting with the easier ones to the hard ones so you can get quick wins first to boost confidence.
    3. Proofreading â†’ Use last 10 minutes to proofread and correct any mistake you find or add important information
