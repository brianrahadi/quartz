Writing is probably my most hated courses while also one of the things I enjoy doing in my free time. I find the ability to distill ideas and compress it into words as an exceptional skill that AI can't even replicate yet. Thus, I'll try to write whenever any good idea hovers around.

Some of my writings:

- [College Transfer Pros and Cons](notes/university-transfer-benefits-and-tips)
- [Why You should Write More](notes/whywrite)
- [Summer 2022 Term Review](notes/term-review-2022summer.md)
- [Fall 2022 Term Review](notes/term-review-2022fall.md)
