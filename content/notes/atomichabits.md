> ”We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act, but a habit.”                 - Aristotle

“The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.”

- **Habits = Freedom:** “Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the *least* amount of freedom.”
- **Systems > Goals:** “My results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.” You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
- **Effective Habits:** “There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems.”
- **Clarity > Motivation:** “Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.”
- **Environment > Motivation:** “Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More…Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you *really* wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.”
- Change your **outcome-based habits** (I am quitting smoking because i want to be healthy) to **identity-based habits** (I am not a smoker, why should i smoke?)

**Building Good Habits**

1. Cue (Make it Obvious) : Implement habit stacking with time and location also add things you want to do around you.
    - To break bad habit, reduce your exposure towards the cue of bad habits
2. Craving (Make it Attractive) : Use temptation bundling (After workout, you can finally take a shower and break)

    - Your environment around you shapes you. (Workout community support each other to become fit)
    - For bad habits, you can shift your mindset that this particular habit destroys you and it is not attractive at all.
3. Response (Make it easy) : Start very small everyday, but never stop or go backward
4. Reward (Make it satisfying)
