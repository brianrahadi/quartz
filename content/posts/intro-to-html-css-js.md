Along with my amazing website commitee friends, we have successfully conducted a website workshop this May. 

I want to post this in case you are curious and want to learn HTML/ CSS/ JS by building personal portfolio website and deploying it to the internet.

So, how to navigate? Just follow the youtube videos as I will show you what are all of these. I will code the code demonstrated in GitHub and use the Notion Handbook for references.
