Disclaimer: This guide is mainly intended for those aiming to get a computer science internship. I don't know anything outside these areas, but I'm pretty sure some of the ideas presented here can still be relevant to these other areas. I am also learning, so if there is anything that you think is wrong, I would be really happy if you messaged me about this (via email first, and I'll give more contact info).

# Intro  
When I was in high school, I was really fascinated by many day-in-the-life-of-a-software-engineer-intern videos. I find it interesting how the world has changed, and now people can just stay in front of the computer to make a living. I mean, it may sound kind of dystopian, but working on fancy technologies in a high-rise office definitely does not sound as bad.

Fast forward, The spring 2023 (Januaryâ€“April) term has just concluded, and now I want to reflect on my first co-op seeking process. This is also intended as a guide for those who want to find their first job. Here, I will use the terms "internship" and "co-op" interchangeably just because the word "internship" seems to be known by more people. At least here, co-op is usually part of the degree programme and usually takes longer.

  
In general, getting your first internship is simple but challenging. It requires two steps:  
1. Getting the interview  
2. Passing the interview, a.k.a. getting the offer

  
## 1. Getting the Interview  
To get the interview, you need to get noticed by employers and called for an interview. I would argue that this is harder for a first internship as most of us don't have anything good to show yet. This can easily be improved if you are a student and utilise all the resources given by the university.

Here are some core components that I think will help you get the interviews ordered by significance:  
### 1. Good Resume Format  
First, the resume needs to be relevant, concise, and in.pdf format.

Also, the resume needs to be able to be parsed by [resume parser](https://resume-parser.vercel.app/). Passing the resume parser is important here, as some companies might filter their candidates using this automated parser first before passing it to a person.

In order for your resume to be effectively parsed, you need to have a resume with one column. I'm not sure if you can make it work with two columns, as I have not tried, but better be safe in here. One page is also recommended, as recruiters do not want to spend a lot of time looking at your experiences. More of the explanations are here: https://www.careercup.com/resume.

Finally, if you are looking for a recommendation, I use this famous [Jake's Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs). It uses latex, but Overleaf has an online latex editor that makes it easy to edit it. Make sure to download it as a PDF.

Next, for the contents: Always do a grammar check and write all the bullet points in a concise way while also showing your accomplishments. I used the [STAR method](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/star-interview-method?aceid=&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) to be able to easily outline what I have done concisely. If you are kind of bad at English and finding the perfect words like me, you might want to use [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt). You can ask them, "Reword these bullet points in a resume in a STAR format," and show your current bullet points.

### 2. Work experience  
Ah, the loop that you can never break.  
![[posts/attachments/Pasted image 20230508104800.png]]

Why do I need to make this point if the post is about someone getting their first co-op? Surely none would have any relevant work experience, right? You are half-correct. Most people would never have any relevant, in this case, developer job. But you can always try to get one or even others that have no direct relevance.

First, if you are a student, Getting a tutoring job can be beneficial, as it will show that you can communicate your thoughts clearly to teach people. In fact, many universities always need peer tutors or teaching assistants. I applied for a teaching assistant job back when I was at Langara, and I am forever grateful for that decision. I was really pessimistic, as I have tried applying for many opportunities in the past but never got in. Taking that first step in applying is crucial.

### 3. Technical projects  
Projects are a huge part of what makes applying to CS jobs different from other professions. The fact that we need to build something in our free time to get those jobs can be daunting. For me, though, I think this is a good benefit to have. As we are more likely to be assessed by our projects, which we can continuously develop over time, and not our grades, which can only be evaluated mostly on the 2-hour exams.

To have good projects, you need to find problems that you think you'd enjoy solving. Alternatively, you can also choose a domain in computer science in which you want to specialise. Here are some domains that I see as having some prospects (at least on the job board):  
1. Web development  
If you think you enjoy this, I recommend starting to learn from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and starting to build projects from there. There are also many projects on YouTube that you can learn from.  
2. AI/ ML  
Arguably the most exciting part of CS, I don't specialise in this. But I have heard that [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_machine-learning-introduction_stanford_FTCOF_specializations_country-US-country-CA) to be a really good one.  
3. Game Development  
This can also be related to graphics. I also never had the chance to try this. I would try finding a Unity 2D or 3D course on YouTube or Udemy to learn from.  
4. Embedded Programming  
This is probably the domain with the least competition but with good prospects too. Taking an embedded programming course can be a good start. SFU has [CMPT 433](https://opencoursehub.cs.sfu.ca/bfraser/grav-cms/cmpt433/course-info) if you are interested.

There might be more niche domains, but there are these four types of projects. If you are truly sure of what kind of internship role you want to get, I think having projects focused on one domain will be really helpful in making you stand out as a candidate.

What has worked for me to have these projects is to focus on classes that give good projects first. This is what I did as I took CMPT 213 (Object Oriented Design), which gives me a Java Swing and OOP project; CMPT 272 (Web Development), which gives me an Angular project; and CMPT 276 (Software Engineering), which gives me a full-stack web development group project.

You can also do projects at hackathons, which generally take the least amount of time. Just make sure you have a good teammate and have a good plan for what you think you will be doing.

### 4. Organisation experience  
For most people, doing things alone can be a bit stressful, so why not make it fun by doing it with others or for others?

I find the most rewards in building things for organisations, as I know the result is useful for others too. Try finding tech-related organisations if you want to find more like-minded peers. Alternatively, you can just try to be in any organisation you'd like to be in and offer to build something for them to make club life easier. The most common one is probably a website for that organisation.

I really enjoy being in an organisation, as I think community plays a big part in who we are and the enjoyment that comes from there.

### 5. Credits Taken  
A.k.a. expected graduation date. I try to set the earliest possible graduation date.

Most companies are more likely to hire candidates near their graduation, as internships are basically a relatively reliable way to get good full-time candidates.

Thus, having a delayed internship might not be a bad idea at all, as (1) it is usually easier to get one and (2) there are more chances for the company to offer you a full-time position.

### 6. GPA  
Does GPA matter? Hmm, I don't know, and I don't think you need to worry too much about this. Some companies might think it matters; others might not think about it at all.

What you can do is study consistently while also maintaining your other areas of life.

Right now, school life is not really my highest priority. I just need to make sure that I finish all the assignments and quizzes on time and get the general gist of it. Prioritising projects, organisations, work, or even making sure you are not burned out and enjoy life is definitely more important.

This is a big realisation for me now that I have transferred to the university. This might not be the case at all if you need to transfer or pursuing graduate school.

Look at what kind of life you want to be living 5 or 10 years from now and reverse engineer it from there. From this perspective, I see grades as not really important. This is also coming from a person who had a quite challenging high school experience in Indonesia. I realised how much time I spent studying, which made me ignore other areas of life. Life is short, and I need to make sure that I get the most out of it.

  
### 7. Extra Tips  
There are also many highly underrated tips that I know will boost your application chances:  
1. Apply early! if possible, on the first day the application is open.

Most companies interview their candidates on a rolling basis. It means they will not wait until the due date of the application to start interviewing. This means the earlier you are, the more chances you have, as the internship slot still remains open.

This means that sometimes late applicants, no matter how good they are, may never be looked at at all if the slot is already filled.

2. Get referrals.

I have never really done this step, but I know some of my friends who have. Having referrals truly helps in securing that first round of interviews. I thought that this was kind of unethical because someone with referrals may get interviews even though they are less qualified. But this is simply false; the employer who made that referral may be putting their credibility in jeopardy as they recommend this worker as good.  
Â  Â Â   
Word of mouth, after all, plays a huge role in how we operate in society. We can easily trust another person if a trusted friend recommends them to us.

3. Message recruiters on LinkedIn.

This strategy, even though it seems a bit impolite at first, can be proven very effective. Make sure that you reword your message to be professional and direct, and expect nothing in return. It is also highly recommended that you show interest in that company by explaining what you have done that may be related to what they are currently doing.

In fact, this is what one of my friends did, and it actually landed them a job as a software engineer intern. You never know where it might take you.

4. Expect failure and fear not trying.

What has worked for me to still keep applying every day is to always treat failure as the expected scenario. I think this is quite easy for people who are generally still finding their first co-op. After all, it stinks, but it's really not the end of the world if we don't get it, right? But now that we still have the chance, it's best to always keep trying.

## 2.Â  Passing the Interview

An interview can be very nerve-wracking, especially if you don't have much experience with it.

Personally, I don't have any experience with this, as I have only been in two technical interviews. I can only learn from this, especially from the one that got me an offer.

### 1. Show Interest

Companies really like it if you are genuinely interested in their mission. You can show this by researching their product and what they have done. You can also share this research with them via a link (Notion or Google Docs).

### 2. Show Personality

Be curious; explain more than necessary, but also make it not too long (2â€“3 sentences max). Also, be authentic by showing your struggles. I think people really admire authenticity, as honesty makes you relate more to them.

Have a webcam that is centred on you, and try to look at the webcam while taking pictures. This will make the interviewer feel like you are directly looking into their eyes.

  
3. Master Algorithms and Data Structures  
If doing projects is the grind for getting the interview, then mastering algorithms is the grind for passing the interview.

Doing [Blind 75](https://neetcode.io/practice) I think that is more than enough to get the first co-op. In fact, I have only finished the first half of it. Just make sure to always revise it and understand, not memorise, the solutions. This will allow you to solve problems you have not encountered before because you already understand the underlying data structures.

### 4. Master Related CS Topics  
In general, you might also need to know object-oriented programming and design.

Knowing [4 OOP Principles](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/oop-principles?aceid=&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds), [SOLID Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), and [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) are very useful. This is what I was tested on in one of my technical interviews. I actually learned most of this from SFU's Object-Oriented Design Course, CMPT 213.

You also need to check the job description. If it requires other knowledge like networking, functional programming, and other related stuff. You may need to prepare yourself for these things too.

### 5. Have Fun  
The last but most important thing to have, I think, is to just enjoy it. Even if you fail, you will still get something out of it. Sometimes you pass it, and other times you learn from it.

There are no better ways to get better at an interview than to keep0 doing it. I have been there, but I will definitely practise this message.

  
## Conclusion  
This is all for now. I really hope this guide can be useful to you. Getting an internship, especially the first one, can be really hard. These are just some of the suggestions that I know will be helpful.

I have only written this on the first draught; I will revise this post some time in the future if I have the motivation. Thanks for reading!
