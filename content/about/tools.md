Tools are helpful things I found to enjoy using. It's a notable list of any software and hardware I use daily. My enjoyment of using software that helps people live better kinda pulled me into my current major.

## Software 
Applications:
  - [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/webapp/) serves as my to-do list x habit tracker x pomodoro timer
  - Learning [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to capture my thoughts
  - I also use [Notion](https://notion.so/) occassionally for its tables and collaboration features
  - [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) have helped me to be indistractable
  - [one sec](https://one-sec.app/) and [Opal](https://www.opal.so/) have also helped me tremendously in reducing my phone's social media and screen time consumption
  - [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) is a must have during commute or when writing cringy internet stuff like now.
  - [Kindle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-kindle/id302584613) as my go-to book reader app
  - [Snipd](https://www.snipd.com/) is my podcast app as it allows saving annotations (highlights last 15 seconds)
  - Trying to consistently use [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) to re-read highlights imported from my Kindle and Snipd.

Chrome Extensions:
  - [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) have helped me to block distracting websites during focus hours
  - [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en) mainly to watch lecture recordings in faster speed
  - [Distraction Fee Youtube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna?hl=en) have made me navigate youtube with less temptations. It blocks the trending tabs, youtube shorts, and fully customizable.
  - [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) blocked most social media websites' timeline so I won't need to scroll the hot feeds.
  - [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/dashboard) is really useful when applying for jobs. It auto-fills common inputs in one click.

## Hardware
- I use the [latest MacBook Pro with Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Fourth_generation_(Touch_Bar)) as my daily driver
- I also really enjoy using [LG 34" Ultrawide Monitor](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/lg-34-ultrawide-qhd-60hz-5ms-gtg-curved-ips-lcd-freesync-gaming-monitor-34wp85cn-b-black/16233321?cmp=seo-16233321&cmp=knc-s-71700000055264709&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) as I can open 3 relatively large windows at the same time + my laptop screen.
- I type and scroll with [Logitech Keyboard and Mouse set](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/logitech-logitech-mk850-bluetooth-optical-ergonomic-keyboard-mouse-combo-english-920-008219/10564041). Definitely recommended!
- The set is placed on a [Logitech Studio Desk Mat](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/logitech-studio-desk-mat-mid-grey/15766138) for extra protection and aesthetics ;)
- Sometimes, I am standing with my [Ikea Trotten Standing Desk](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/trotten-desk-sit-stand-white-anthracite-s59429599/)
- If not, I am sitting on my [Kerdom Office Chair](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B096TQKLV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- I try to make time to read books on my [4th Gen Kindle Paperwhite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Tenth_generation)
