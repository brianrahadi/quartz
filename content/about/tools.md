Tools are helpful things I found to enjoy using. It's a notable list of any software and hardware I use daily. My enjoyment of using software that helps people live better kinda pulled me into my current major.

## Software 
- [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/webapp/) serves as my to-do list x habit tracker x pomodoro timer
- Learning [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to capture my thoughts
- I also use [Notion](https://notion.so/) occassionally for its tables and collaboration features
- [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) and [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) have helped me to be indistractable
- [one sec](https://one-sec.app/) and [Opal](https://www.opal.so/) have also helped me tremendously in reducing my phone's social media and screen time consumption


## Hardware
- I use the [latest MacBook Pro with Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Fourth_generation_(Touch_Bar)) as my daily driver
- [This Samsung 27-inch monitor](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/samsung-27-fhd-75hz-5ms-gtg-ips-led-freesync-gaming-monitor-lf27t350fhnxza-dark-blue-grey/14933348?cmp=seo-14933348&cmp=knc-s-71700000074543335&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) is my first external monitor and I have been loving it
- I type and scroll with [Logitech Keyboard and Mouse set](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/logitech-logitech-mk850-bluetooth-optical-ergonomic-keyboard-mouse-combo-english-920-008219/10564041). Definitely recommended!
- The set is placed on a [Logitech Studio Desk Mat](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/logitech-studio-desk-mat-mid-grey/15766138) for extra protection and aesthetics ;)
- Sometimes, I am standing with my [Ikea Trotten Standing Desk](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/trotten-desk-sit-stand-white-anthracite-s59429599/)
- If not, I am sitting on my [Kerdom Office Chair](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B096TQKLV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- I try to make time to read books on my [4th Gen Kindle Paperwhite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Tenth_generation)
