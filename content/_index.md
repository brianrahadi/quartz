Hello! I'm Brian. Currently studying [Software Systems](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html) at Simon Fraser University.

I find the world of software fascinating because of its ability to improve our lives on a seemingly infinity scale.

I am interested in learning all aspects of software development life cycle. From designing beautiful and usable interfaces, using different programming paradigms, to learning and implementing distributed system that powers the current internet.

I enjoy sharing things on the internet. Below are some of it:
- [Experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what I have done;
- [Projects](about/projects.md) I (and my teammates) have built;
- [Tools](about/tools.md) I found useful;
- [Books](about/books.md) I have read;
- [Restaurants](https://brianrahadi.notion.site/Restaurant-Reviews-2762ef471f4c44bf8221683723835e87) I have been to (notion page for now).
