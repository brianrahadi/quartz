Hello! I'm Brian. Currently studying Software Systems (subset of CS) at Simon Fraser University.

I really like software because of how it can magically improves human lives and is almost as it is infinitely scalable while doing so. 

I am interested in all things software. From designing beautiful interfaces, using different programming paradigms, to learning how distributed systems powers the internet as it is today.

I like sharing things on the internet. Below are some of it:
- [Experience](notes/experience.md) or summary of what I have been doing
- [Projects](notes/projects.md) I (and my teammates) have built
- [Tools](notes/tools.md) that have helped me tremendously
- [Books](notes/books.md) I have read
- [Blog](notes/blog.md) containing my amateur writings
- [Restaurants](https://brianrahadi.notion.site/Restaurant-Reviews-2762ef471f4c44bf8221683723835e87) I have been to (notion page for now)
