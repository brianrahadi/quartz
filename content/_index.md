Hello! I'm Brian. Currently studying Software Systems (subset of CS) at Simon Fraser University.

I find the world of software to be fascinating because of its ability to improve our lives on a seemingly infinity scale

I am interested in learning all aspects of software development lifecycle. From designing beautiful interfaces, using different programming paradigms, to learning and implementing distributed system that powers the internet as it is today.

I enjoy sharing things on the internet. Below are some of it:
- [Experience](notes/experience.md) or summary of what I have been doing
- [Projects](notes/projects.md) I (and my teammates) have built
- [Tools](notes/tools.md) that have helped me tremendously
- [Books](notes/books.md) I have read
- [Blog](notes/blog.md) containing my amateur writings
- [Restaurants](https://brianrahadi.notion.site/Restaurant-Reviews-2762ef471f4c44bf8221683723835e87) I have been to (notion page for now)
