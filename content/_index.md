Hello! I'm Brian. Currently studying [Software Systems](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/programs/degree-programs/softwaresystems.html) at Simon Fraser University.

I find the software world fascinating because of its ability to improve our lives on a seemingly infinite scale.

I am interested in learning all aspects of the software development life cycle. From designing beautiful and usable interfaces, using different programming paradigms, to learning about distributed systems.

I enjoy sharing things on the internet. Below are some of them:
- [Posts](posts/) I have shared to the internet;
- [Experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what I have done;
- [Projects](about/projects.md) I (and my teammates) have built;
- [Notes](notes/) I took;
- [Tools](about/tools.md) I found useful;
- [Books](about/books.md) I have read;
- [Restaurants](https://brianrahadi.notion.site/Restaurant-Reviews-2762ef471f4c44bf8221683723835e87) I have been to (notion page for now).
